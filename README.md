As you can see I had a bit of a rough start on Friday. Through perseverance, things finally worked out to a place that I feel is progress. I have successfully built a calendar, created a visual landscape with tree components iterated through state input. I plan an connecting calendar based input and tree iteration (with coordinates related to date). From there I will create user authentication and connect the storage of data onto a database.
