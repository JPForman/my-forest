10-11 --- Researched environment
11-12 --- Rebuild

12:30-1:30 --- Webpack issues
1:30-2:30 --- Research and partial calendar  
3:30-5 --- Calendar tutorial

As you can see I had a bit of a rough start on Friday. I just kept at it and things finally worked out to a place that I feel I made progress. I know my commit history is kinda shotty, which is abnormal, but I had a few complete rebuilds that I just wanted in a different repo. My first submission has one of the earliest commits (https://github.com/JPForman/myForest.git , the earliest was deleted locally). Sorry for the confusion. I assure you I put in the hours from 8am-5, and most of the weekend thereafter.  

In terms of where my project status is, I have successfully built a calendar and created a visual landscape with tree components iterated through state input. I plan on connecting calendar based input with tree iteration (associating coordinates with date). From there I will create user authentication and connect the storage of data onto a database. Further features include the introduction of more elements (eg grass, flowers, etc.), classic graphs of personal data, birds flying in the functions of tracked data.
